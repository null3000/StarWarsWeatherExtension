/**
 * Telemetry facade over the Moderok SDK.
 *
 * Per-render events were ~85% of volume and kept blowing the monthly quota, so
 * activity is accumulated in localStorage and emitted as `daily_activity` rollups per
 * user per UTC day: one at rollover, plus up to MAX_PARTIAL_FLUSHES throttled ones on
 * page hide so a user who stops opening tabs still reports their last day. Counters
 * are deltas since the previous rollup and sum to the day; the rest is a snapshot.
 *
 * Sampling is by user (hash bucket), never by event, so unique-user counts and
 * in-cohort ratios stay valid and totals scale back up by the sample rate. Buckets
 * nest: every `new_tab` user is also a `daily_activity` user, so the raw stream can be
 * reconciled against the same users' rollups.
 *
 * INGEST CONTRACT: `daily_activity` is at-least-once. Pages share one localStorage
 * record and localStorage has no compare-and-swap, so a rollup can be sent twice.
 * Duplicates carry the same (userId, date, sequence, partial) and ingest MUST dedup on
 * that tuple. Failing this direction is deliberate: a duplicate is droppable, while a
 * destroyed slice leaves nothing behind and the OWM quota projection reads it as a
 * quiet day.
